Soft Nebula Generator/Noisy Nebula Generator With Flow Field

<b>Important parameters:</b>
  1) bg images for burn application
  2) flow field density/variation
  3) 'mod' for different size canvases, though it works best with default 1080/1920
  4) 'baseRGB' for primary color
  5) particle counts for flow field trails
  6) createSpecificCloud - (low/high range for noise application, size of paint group, paint iterations/layers
      proliferation of paint (density of application), color(r,g,b), noStroke or stroke)
